                            Everyone knows that there are four skills in learning a language, namely listening,
                            speaking,
                            reading
                            and writing. They are always related in terms of usage, and <strong>speaking</strong> is
                            viewed
                            by
                            learners as the most desirable skill in
                            face-to-face communication in the globalization era. However, what is the answer to the
                            following
                            questions?
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What do you have to do before you can speak?</li>
                            <li>What does a child learn before he talks?</li>
                            <li>What do we do before chatting?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Listen</strong>, of course!</p>
                        <p>
                            Naturally, children begin listening to their parents when they are babies. They are often
                            greeted,
                            spoken to and admired without any response expected. Though nobody knows if the baby
                            understands
                            the
                            spoken words, the process continues. Children automatically
                            acquire such language over some time, and later on gradually produce it through actual
                            experience.
                            The
                            production may be incomplete at first, but successful at last. That leads to speaking skill
                            which is
                            quite applicable to daily conversation.<span class="dots" id="dots-1">...</span>
                        </p>

                                In learning English, listening can help improve speaking considerably. Although it is
                                the first
                                of
                                all
                                skills, it is neither the easiest nor the most meaningless. We need to hear various
                                types of
                                English
                                repeatedly and continuously if we want to communicate
                                properly, meaningfully and naturally.

                            <h4>Why is listening good?</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>When listening, we are reviewing a lot of English usage such as vocabulary,
                                    grammatical
                                    structures,
                                    intonation, accent and our own interpretation.</li>
                                <li>We can learn new words and expressions by hearing them frequently.</li>
                                <li>Besides the English revision, general knowledge from news, features, or even
                                    advertising
                                    spots
                                    is
                                    certainly beneficial for regular listeners.</li>
                                <li>We can imitate what we hear and apply it with great confidence.</li>
                                <li>Listening can be a good "hobby" while we do other things such as cooking, ironing,
                                    exercising,
                                    relaxing etc. In other words, we have no wasted time at all.</li>
                                <li>Listening is also a great way to train our attention.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h4>How can we listen to English?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Nowadays, radio cassette recorders are household appliances, but we often overlook their
                                radio
                                function.
                                We can experience English language radio programmes almost anywhere in the world. They
                                are
                                usually
                                picked up on FM bands and aired particularly for
                                foreigners. Short wave radio programmes are another option. Two of the most easily found
                                English
                                language broadcasters are the BBC and Voice of America. Today, you can even access them
                                by
                                internet.

                        <p>Students who are learning English will make more progress if they are aware of how listening
                            processes
                            work and how those processes apply to their own experiences. To foster this awareness, we
                            set up
                            listening practice sessions where students
                            have an opportunity to learn, use and evaluate different metacognitive listening strategies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We start by emphasizing to students that they are constantly employing these skills in their
                            daily
                            lives
                            and that they probably use many of them in their native languages automatically. This
                            practice
                            activity
                            is designed to help them develop this same
                            automaticity in English.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before our students start a session, we give them a listening practice sheet to fill out,
                            guided
                            by
                            the
                            questions below.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Before Listening: <em>What do I already know? What predictions can I make? </em></p>
                            <p>While Listening: <em>What strategies can I use to help me understand what I’m listening
                                    to?
                                </em>
                            </p>
                            <p>After Listening: <em>Which strategies helped me the most? What will I do next time?</em>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>You can use these questions with almost any audio text, whether podcasts, speeches, videos,
                            movie
                            clips,
                            dialogues or news reports. The first time we do this as a class, however, we model our own
                            listening
                            strategies while filling it out. Here’s

                                We start by writing the title of the audio text on the board and telling students what
                                type of
                                text
                                it
                                is. For example, we might have students watch the above Times video, “Why Do Bees Buzz?”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the first section of our listening practice sheet, we ask them to write what they
                                already
                                know
                                about
                                the title — if anything. In the “Why Do Bees Buzz?” example, they might say that bees
                                fly, make
                                a
                                buzzing sound and sting people. Students then share
                                their writing with a partner or in a small group to generate more ideas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, based on this knowledge, students write their predictions about the content of the
                                text.
                                For
                                instance, they might predict that the video will say that bees buzz to talk with each

                                Next, we ask students to list strategies that might help them understand the text while
                                they
                                listen
                                to
                                it. We remind them that many of the strategies they use for reading can also be applied
                                to
                                listening.
                                Students might come up with things like summarizing,
                                using context clues to guess word meanings, asking questions or visualizing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, we play the text and, while they listen, students practice using one or more of
                                these
                                strategies.
                            </p>
                            <em>
                                Note: If you are playing a text for the whole class either on speakers or on a screen,
                                you might
                                pause
                                it every so often and replay it so students can practice these strategies. If you have
                                the
                                resources,
                                you can also have students listen to the text using their own devices and headphones so
                                they can
                                pause
                                and replay as needed.

                            <h4>After listening: <em> strategies helped me the most? What will I do next time?</em></h4>
                            <p>
                                After they are finished, we have students use the third section of our listening
                                practice sheet
                                to
                                reflect on which strategies were most helpful and what was particularly difficult about
                                the
                                task.
                                Then,
                                we ask them to share their reflections and how they
                                might improve their skills.

                                This activity focuses on helping students name what they do while they listen —
                                strategies that
                                are
                                often invisible. The emphasis in this type of practice is less about teaching new
                                content than
                                it is
                                about teaching students how to listen.

                    <h3>What is Speaking?</h3>

                            <strong>Speaking</strong> is the delivery of language through the mouth. To speak, we create
                            sounds
                            using
                            many parts of our body, including the lungs, vocal tract, vocal chords, tongue, teeth and
                            lips.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This vocalized form of language usually requires at least one listener. When two or more
                            people
                            speak or
                            talk to each other, the conversation is called a &quot;dialogue&quot;. Speech can flow
                            naturally
                            from
                            one
                            person to another in the form of dialogue.
                            It can also be planned and rehearsed, as in the delivery of a speech or presentation. Of
                            course,
                            some
                            people
                            talk to themselves! In fact, some English learners practise speaking standing alone in front
                            of
                            a
                            mirror.
                        </p>

                        <p>Speaking can be formal or informal:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Informal speaking is typically used with family and friends, or people you know well.
                            </li>
                            <li>Formal speaking occurs in business or academic situations, or when meeting people for
                                the
                                first
                                time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Speaking is probably the language skill that most language learners wish to perfect as soon
                            as
                            possible.
                            It
                            used to be the only language skill that was difficult to practise online. This is no longer
                            the
                            case.
                            English learners can practise speaking online
                            using voice or video chat and services like Skype. They can also record and upload their
                            voice
                            for

                            One of the areas that English students find most difficult is SPEAKING. Many students feel
                            confident
                            about
                            reading, writing, and even understanding, but when it comes to speaking they just can’t
                            verbalize
                            the
                            words.Fortunately, the internet has more and
                            more options for you to get out to the world and practice your English with real people in
                            real
                            conversations, but it takes courage.

                        <p>
                            But with the right resources, a little bit of courage, and a lot of perseverance, the world
                            is
                            your
                            oyster
                            (it’s full of opportunities). Today we’re going to give you some tips, and share 5 great
                            resources
                            for
                            you
                            to practice speaking English online.
                        </p>
                        <p>To start with, let’s cover the top reasons that you know how to read and write, but not

                            <p>
                                <em>First</em>, traditional English classes emphasize writing, reading and grammar more
                                than
                                speaking
                                (partly because in larger classes its hard to give students the individual attention
                                they
                                need
                                to

                                <em>Second</em>, students find speaking scary. But like any fear, the only way to
                                overcome
                                it is
                                to
                                face
                                it.
                                This means that in order to feel more confident and less afraid of speaking, you must
                                start
                                speaking,

                                <em>Third</em>, students feel like there are no opportunities to speak with native
                                speakers
                                (or

                                non-native speakers from their own country). Maybe you live in a small town, and there

                                living there. Or you live
                                in a big city, and you’re just not sure HOW to meet native English speakers (if you do
                                live

                                your
                                abilities—you
                                know another language!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Something I notice a lot with my students is under-confidence. They think that they
                                don’t
                                speak
                                English
                                well
                                because they make little grammatical mistakes. All of my students, whether beginner or
                                advanced,
                                speak
                                English much better than they think they
                                do. I GUARANTEE that you do, too. If you understand most of what you’re reading right
                                now,
                                then
                                your
                                English
                                must be pretty damn good. So feel confident. And be proud of your mistakes. The more
                                mistakes
                                you
                                make,
                                the
                                faster you can correct
                                them and improve your English. Don’t fear mistakes, embrace them.
                            </p>

                                Lastly, stop seeking perfection! Even I don’t speak English perfectly–you probably don’t
                                speak
                                your
                                native
                                language perfectly either! We all have moments when we can’t think of the right word, or
                                where
                                we’re
                                not
                                certain if we’ve said something in the
                                best way, but in our native language it doesn’t matter because we are so used to
                                speaking it
                                and
                                so
                                we
                                have
                                no fear.Now let’s START SPEAKING English. Today we are going to talk about SIX awesome

                                This used to be one of the websites that I most highly recommended to my students for
                                speaking.
                                However,
                                through recent changes, there are far fewer free aspects to this website. Despite this,
                                there
                                are

                            <p>
                                Chat Roulette isn’t necessarily for language learning, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a
                                great
                                tool.
                                It
                                hooks
                                you up with another random user to video chat with. It is most popular in the United
                                States
                                and
                                the
                                UK,
                                so
                                it means you can meet someone and talk
                                about anything! Chat Roulette is definitely recommendable for advanced English students.
                                Note:
