                <div class="imageArticle-article">
                    <p>Writing simply would not be writing without the rules that shape words and string together
                        sentences into fluid paragraphs and comprehensible arguments. We use these rules every day while
                        sending text messages, writing essays, producing business reports, or even when we update
                        Facebook statuses. Yet, despite the prevalence of writing in our everyday lives, proper grammar
                        has been kicked to the curb. The apparent grammar disconnect is hard to trace. Children are
                        educated in grammar basics starting in elementary school, but despite efforts from the Common
                        Core standards and other educational bodies, many professionals believe the informality of new
                        technologies and the changing modes of communication have weakened the emphasis on proper
                        grammar. My research primarily focuses on how professional grammar deficiencies stem from
                        inadequate grammar teaching and changes in communication methods, and how, to some degree, the
                        ability to construct sentences is analogous to the ability to construct thoughts. Therefore,
                        understanding and employing proper grammar are important for both educational and professional
                        success.<span class="dots" id="dots-1">...</span>

                        <h4>Understanding Grammar in Context</h4>
                        <p>Before analyzing the impact of grammar, its meaning must first be clarified. Different
                            definitions of grammar exist in different contexts. While the New Oxford American Dictionary
                            defines grammar as “the whole system and structure of a language or of languages in
                            general,” a linguist’s definition of grammar can be more subjective. For example, radical
                            linguist Noam Chomsky introduced the idea of universal grammar, which is the idea that
                            “children are born with the innate capacity to master language, a power imbued in our
                            species by evolution itself” (Ross). Chomsky further pursues this idea by saying our
                            internal sense of grammar is what uniquely allows humans to “form plans, do creative art,
                            and develop complex societies” (Ross). While the idea of “universal grammar” seems plausible
                            to some degree, the concept of teachable grammar is more widely accepted.
                        </p>

                        <p>An interesting approach to grammar teaching is addressed in the International Journal of
                            Research Studies
                            in Language Learning by Indian researchers Samuel Praise and K. Meenakshi, who define
                            grammar as “merely a set of rules to preserve the written word” (Praise). The main point
                            Praise and Meenakshi make is that “grammar is not taught in isolation but often arises out
                            of communicative task,” and therefore, in learning language, “opportunities are provided for
                            both inductive and deductive learning of grammar” (Praise). This implies a correlation
                            between grammar and communication, which supports Chomsky’s theory that understanding proper
                            grammar is what allows people to conceive and execute plans. By drawing this parallel,
                            Chomsky, Praise, and Meenakshi suggest that grammar has greater implications than simply
                            constructing sentences.
                        </p>

                        <h4>"Texting Culture" and Communication</h4>
                        <p>This trend toward informality is not uncommon, and also reflects current “texting culture.” A
                            2012 journal article by undergraduate student Elizabeth Gorney discusses how factors such as
                            “email, texting, and Facebook have led to new words forming, new grammatical changes, and
                            other modifications that are both subtle and noticeable” (Gorney). Gorney attributes “the
                            technology and speed that messages can be delivered” to the consequential change in grammar
                            usage (Gorney). In particular, Gorney cites abbreviations as a downfall: “though
                            abbreviations do allow for faster communication, they take away the eloquence of [language,
                            are unprofessional, and potentially create] a loss of understanding between people”
                            (Gorney). Generally speaking, the developing “texting culture” is one of speed and
                            convenience. Yet this convenience comes at a cost; the price of using abbreviations and
                            fragmented sentence structure is proper grammar. This declining grammar usage on all
                            fronts—personal, educational, and professional—has been attributed to the convenience of not
                            using proper syntax. Therefore, it is a fair assumption that disregarding grammar is what
                            makes texting language so convenient.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Explicit and Implicit Functions</h4>
                        <p>Perhaps writing informally is convenient, but it is certainly not practical. Correct grammar
                            serves explicit and implicit functions that extend to how people structure their thoughts.
                            English Professor Samuel Keyser discusses this phenomenon within the context of grammar
                            teaching in elementary education: “[it] is possible to look at grammar as attempting to
                            teach children how to make, critically examine, and reformulate hypotheses about
                            language—using their own knowledge of English” (Keyser, 40). The conclusions young students
                            can draw from grammar studies teach them the valuable tool of deductive reasoning. In fact,
                            it is through grammatical structure that people learn how to create strong arguments. Keyser
                            conveys this idea through lesson plan examples that show how drawing distinctions in the
                            English language enables students to “analyze and criticize statements which use this
                            distinction implicitly” (Keyser, 44). For example, as early as elementary education,
                            students learn that many verbs and adjectives create restrictions on their subjects and
                            objects. While a painting can be pleasing to a person, a person cannot be pleasing to a
                            painting. By distinguishing the correct contextual verb and adjective usages, young students
                            are creating grammar constructs that allow them to better express ideas and better
                            understand the English language
                        </p>

                        <h4>Professional Importance</h4>
                        <p>
                            Generally speaking, students are taught the grammar basics in primary education. They learn
                            how to use punctuation, how to conjugate verbs, and how to think critically, among other
                            lessons. Yet the attention given to grammar has been replaced by an emphasis on
                            comprehension. This unfortunate reality has created the misconception that one does not need
                            proper grammar to convey an idea. The effects of the devaluation of grammar coupled with the
                            aforementioned texting culture can particularly be seen in the professional sphere. Despite
                            the perceived change in grammar usage employer expectations remain unchanged. According to
                            Sue Shellenbarger, a writer for The Wall Street Journal, “managers are fighting an epidemic
                            of grammar gaffes in the workplace” (Shellenbarger). Shellenbarger further cites a survey
                            conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management: “about 45 percent of 430 employers
                            said they were increasing employee-training programs to improve employees’ grammar and other
                            skills” (Shellenbarger). The impact of poor grammar can be detrimental in the professional
                            setting. “[S]uch looseness with language can create bad impressions with clients, ruin
                            marketing materials and cause communications errors” (Shellenbarger). In a Forbes Magazine
                            article responding to Shellenbarger, Susan Adams notes that “language is constantly
                            changing, and often [these] changes bubble up from informal usage” (Adams). Adams also
                            quotes Kyle Wiens, the CEO of an online repair manual called iFixit, who claims that “he
                            [will not] hire people who have bad grammar [and] gives all of his job applicants a grammar
                            test” (Adams). Both speaking and writing well involve a level of intelligence and
                            thoughtfulness that is demonstrated through proper grammar. Grammar organizes the words that
                            create big picture ideas, which, without structure, would be exceptionally less convincing.

                <h3>Why Does Grammar Matter? </h3>
                <img src="media/grammar-2.jpeg" alt="an image of grammar" class="imageArticle-img">
                <div class="imageArticle-article">
                    <p>After 20 years of teaching academic writing to both native speakers and English language
                        learners, I can attest that at some point, just about everyone asks me why, or even whether,
                        grammar matters.
                    </p>

                    <p>There is more than one way to define grammar. Linguists – the people who study language – define
                        “grammar” as a description of how a language operates. Though some people use it to bully people
                        for making mistakes, grammar is not a way to decide if language is right or wrong. Everyone
                        makes mistakes, and the English language is amazingly flexible in how its pieces can be put
                        together and understood.
                    </p>

                    <p>That’s because English is a “living” language, actively spoken by people worldwide. It grows and
                        changes, picking up new words and new ways of constructing meaning all the time.<span
                            class="dots" id="dots-2">...</span>
                    </p>

                    <!-- the content below will show up when the "Read more" button is clicked and 
                         it will be hidden when the "Read less" button is clicked-->
                    <div class="more-content" id="more-content-2">
                        <p>AAll kinds of factors influence the way people talk, including regional variations, age,
                            ethnicity, education level and technology. People from Indianapolis use English differently
                            than people from Alaska or Georgia. And American English sounds and works differently than
                            the English spoken in England, Jamaica or India. But they are all still considered English.
                        </p>

                        <p>Through reading, writing and speaking, you have already learned quite a bit about how English
                            works. You began your education in grammar when you first started using simple sentences.
                            For example, my son had to learn to say “carry me,” not “carry you,” when he wanted to be
                            picked up. That’s grammar, even though you didn’t always call it that.
                        </p>

                        <p>The school subject we call grammar is the next step. It establishes some ground rules that
                            attempt to define what can be considered a more uniform, established version of English.
                            There is a complicated history of how those rules were created and who benefits from them.
                            The end result is that schools teach the kind of English students in their country will be
                            expected to use in public, at work and in formal writing.

                        <p>Writing exists to be read. So the reader must be considered when you construct sentences. You
                            write differently for your friends, your parents and your teacher. The grammar you learn in
                            school helps you meet the expectations of the reader. They also learned a similar grammar in
                            school.
                        </p>

                        <p>Wait, did I just make a grammar mistake using “they” – plural – to refer to a
                            singular“reader”?</p>

                        <p>Well, maybe not. Remember how I said English is a living language? The use of “their” as a
                            singular, nongendered pronoun is one example of how the language is changing. Traditionally,
                            I would have written “he,” because for so long male was the default gender. As the social
                            thinking about gender changed, people began to write “he or she” to be more inclusive. Now
                            we can use “they,” which is all-encompassing.</p>

                        <p>That shift will continue to be debated, as will starting a sentence with a conjunction like
                            “but” or “and,” which used to be discouraged. But I think I get why these changes are
                            happening: They mimic speech.
                        </p>

                        <p>Studying grammar helps make communication between people clearer. Once you understand your
                            own language and appreciate its patterns and varieties, you can more easily understand how
                            other languages are constructed, making them easier to learn. Being able to understand
                            across languages allows you to share your ideas and the ideas of others more broadly.

                    <p>Everyone knows that in the sentence “Jane is washing her”, the pronoun “her” cannot refer back to
                        Jane. Over the last four decades, researchers have established that adults reject the
                        interpretation of Jane and her being the same person. But until they are about six-years-old,
                        English-speaking children sometimes accept that interpretation. They accept that “Jane is
                        washing her” can mean the same as “Jane is washing herself.”
                    </p>

                    <p>In other words, English children are often not accurate with the interpretation of pronouns, even
                        though they actively use them. You can pay attention to the children around you to see whether
                        you can detect this error.
                    </p>

                    <p>These kinds of mistakes are also made by adults learning English and new research we’re currently
                        working on explains how this happens and how it could be used to help language teachers stamp
                        these errors out.<span class="dots" id="dots-3">...</span>

                            An example from <a
                                href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327817la0103_2#.VKz30XveIZ8"> famous
                                1990 study</a>
                            shows how children get the distinction wrong. In the
                            picture below, we see Mama bear touching her own shoulder. The experimenter says: “This is
                            Mama Bear. This is Goldilocks. Is Mama Bear touching her?” The reasoning is that, if the
                            children have the same grammatical knowledge as adults, they should know that “her” must
                            refer to Goldilocks, so they should answer “no”. If they answer “yes,” it means they allow
                            “her” to refer to Mama Bear.

                        <p>The researchers, Yu-Chin Chien and Kenneth Wexler, found that five to six-year-old children
                            get
                            it wrong about half (51%) of the time. It’s as good as chance, or as another researcher, the

                            they are guessing.

                        <p>Even more counter-intuitively, children are actually better at understanding questions such
                            as “is every bear touching her”, where there is more than one bear – as in the picture
                            below. When presented with this picture, children got it wrong only 16% of the time.</p>

                        <h2>Too much going on at once</h2>

                        <p>It’s truly puzzling why children are better at understanding more complex sentences than
                            simpler
                            ones.
                            The
                            answer lies in linguistic theory. <a
                                href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/interface-strategies">Reinhart</a>
                            proposed that children have as good a chance of getting it right than wrong, just because it
                            is
                            a
                            very
                            complex task.</p>

                        <p>In evaluating the meaning of pronouns, children make use of something called “accidental
                            co-reference”,
                            typically used by adults too. To understand this, imagine the following scene from the film
                            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053463/">Side Effects</a>. When explaining an accident
                            suffered
                            by
                            one of her patients a psychiatrist, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, says: “The patient
                            blamed
                            me.
                            The
                            patient’s husband blamed me. Even I blamed me.”
                        </p>

                        <p>Adults understand that, under these very special conditions, “me” can refer back to the
                            subject
                            of
                            the
                            sentence: “I”. But children consider this very limited interpretation as a regular one, and
                            juggle
                            it
                            together with the usual way of interpreting pronouns, to see which one fits the situation.
                        </p>

                        <p>Evaluating two linguistic derivations at the same time is very taxing for children: it
                            exhausts
                            their
                            limited
                            processing resources. So they metaphorically throw up their hands in the air and resort to
                            guessing.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Are reduced pronouns easier?</h2>

                        <p>A <a href="http://www.bu.edu/bucld/files/2013/07/2012-handbook-web-version.pdf">2012
                                study</a> by
                            researchers
                            from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jeremy Hartman, Yasutada Sudo, and Ken
                            Wexler,
                            went
                            further
                            and evaluated children’s understanding of full pronouns (“Cow labeled him”) versus reduced
                            English
                            pronouns
                            (as in “Cow labeled ’m”). Their prediction was that children would be much more accurate
                            with
                            the
                            reduced
                            pronouns than the full ones because reduced pronouns do not allow the accidental coreference
                            interpretation.
                        </p>

                        <p>They found that the children they surveyed, who had an average age of five, produced 52%
                            adult-like
                            responses
                            when presented with the full pronouns, but 80% adult-like responses with the reduced
                            pronouns.
                            In
                            other
                            words, the reduced pronouns were easier to understand.</p>

                        <h2>Extending this to language learners</h2>

                        <p>In <a href="http://www.bu.edu/bucld/conference-info/schedule/">our own forthcoming
                                research</a>,
                            my
                            colleague
                            Lydia White and I have extended this to second language learners – French and Spanish
                            speakers
                            who
                            are
                            learning English. Our study involved two identical experiments, in which a story was
                            presented
                            to
                            the
                            participants on a computer screen in written and aural form. They heard a test sentence such
                            as
                            “Harry
                            sprayed’m” in experiment one and “Harry sprayed him” in experiment two. </p>

                        <p>Participants had to judge whether a test sentence – such as Harry sprayed’m – was true or
                            false
                            with
                            respect
                            to the context. We also tested whether the number of people referenced in the sentence made
                            a
                            difference:
                            they were asked if every boy sprayed him, or just one person (Harry) did, as in Chien and
                            Wexler’s
                            experiment above. We predicted that the complex referent (every boy) would actually turn out
                            to
                            be
                            easier,
                            because it doesn’t allow them to make accidental co-reference.</p>

                        <p>As the graph above illustrates, those learners with an intermediate level of English were
                            more
                            accurate
                            when
                            it came to the more complex test sentences referring to more than one person (the green
                            line),
                            compared
                            to
                            simpler ones with just one (the purple line). Our language learners were also more accurate
                            with
                            reduced
                            pronouns versus full pronouns. </p>

                        <h2>It gets easier</h2>

                        <p>This means that non-advanced learners of English may have trouble interpreting English
                            pronouns,
                            even
                            though
                            they have similar pronouns in their native language. This is because processing
                            difficulties,
                            similar to
                            those experienced by English children, are implicated in their interpretation of pronouns.
                            But
                            the
                            good
                            news
                            is that they can be overcome with increased language proficiency, as the advanced learners’
                            behaviour
                            indicates – the right hand points on the graph. </p>

                        <p>There is an important implication for language teaching here: teachers should be aware that
                            pronouns
                            are
                            difficult words to interpret, and should give their students ample time and practice with
                            them.
