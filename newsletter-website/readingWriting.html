                            be in

                        <p>To correspond with a typical reading lesson, comprehension strategy instruction can be
                            organized
                            into
                            a
                            three-part framework, with specific activities used <strong>before, during,</strong> and
                            <strong>after</strong> reading.
                        </p>

                        <p>Providing instruction such as the following example allows students to see, learn, and use a

                            of
                            comprehension strategies as they read. Note, however, that the framework is a general one
                            and
                            represents
                            an array of strategies. All of the strategies in this framework do not have to be used with
                            every
                            text

                                readings, or displays of art related to the text), making the text relevant to students
                                in
                                some

                            </li>
                            <li>Activate students' background knowledge important to the content of the text by
                                discussing
                                what
                                students will read and what they already know about its topic and about the text

                        <ul>

                                <li>Ask questions that keep students on track and focus their attention on main ideas
                                    and
                                    important

                                <li>Encourage students to return to any predictions they have made before reading to see
                                    if
                                    they
                                    are

                                    and

                                <li>Offer students opportunities to respond to the reading in various ways, including
                                    through
                                    writing,
                                    dramatic play, music, readers' theatre, videos, debate, or pantomime.</li>

                        <p>It’s not easy to write well, and writing well can sometimes seem unimportant. After all, we
                            live
                            in
                            an
                            era of smartphones, and voicemail, and Instagram. If you don’t enjoy writing, there are many
                            other
                            ways
                            to communicate, ways that don’t even require words. Videos, photos, and emojis can express
                            quite
                            a
                            lot.However, if your goal is to graduate university, become a successful entrepreneur, or
                            get a
                            better
                            job, writing is still an essential skill to learn. It shows your ability to think clearly,
                            and
                            can
                            persuade people—to buy your product, to fund your research, to consider you for a position
                            in
                            their
                            company. Below are five methods I typically recommend to my English students.<span

                            <h4>1. Read and analyze high-quality writing.</h4>
                            <p>This is the oldest method, and still the best, to improve your writing. It’s how
                                Shakespeare and
                                all
                                other great writers of the past learned how to write. When I say ‘good writing’ though,
                                I mean
                                simply
                                writing that has been reviewed and cleaned up by professional editors. You can find this
                                kind of
                                writing
                                in newspapers, magazines, and books – these are the best materials to read.By contrast,
                                a lot of
                                writing
                                online (blogs, message boards, Facebook posts) is poorly edited, and often
                                includes misused words, grammar mistakes, and non-standard punctuation. Learning how to
                                write in
                                English
                                with these sources is risky, because you may learn a lot of bad habits. That said, there
                                is also
                                a
                                lot
                                of excellent writing on the web, available for free.</p>
                            <h4>2. Find a writing partner </h4>
                            <p> To become a better writer, it’s not enough to simply learn a lot of words. You need to
                                practice
                                using
                                them. Along with to reading a lot, you need to write a lot. Obviously, there are many
                                ways to do
                                this:
                                Write every day in a diary. Create your own blog. Share your thoughts on Facebook. Et
                                cetera.
                                You’ll
                                improve your writing faster, however, if you share your writing in places that are
                                designed to
                                give
                                you
                                feedback, either from native English speakers or from fellow student-writers. Here are
                                three
                                options
                                to
                                consider:</p>
                            <h4>3. Learn how to identify bad writing</h4>
                            <p>Nowadays, when most writing applications offer Autocorrect and Grammar Check features,
                                you might
                                expect
                                ‘bad writing’ to have gone extinct. Yet plenty of bad writing still exists, because
                                there are a
                                lot
                                of
                                ways to write badly—even if your spelling and punctuation are perfectly correct.</p>
                            <p>To better understand all of the writing problems he mentions above, I highly recommend
                                reading
                                Pinker’s
                                book. In 300 pages, he carefully explains each way that writers (even highly educated
                                ones) can
                                make
                                mistakes. I’ve read his book three times, and I notice improvements in my writing after
                                each
                                time I
                                do.
                                It’s like an entire Harvard writing course, packed into a book.

                                However, if you can’t afford to buy the book, you can still practice this simple
                                exercise: When
                                you
                                come
                                to something that is confusing to read, stop and try to identify what the problem is.
                            </p>
                            <h4>4. Analyze writing that you enjoy reading.</h4>
                            <p>
                                While reading, you should look for useful words and phrases (and collect them for your
                                writing).
                                You
                                should also be attentive to bad writing (and try to identify what the problems are). But
                                you
                                should
                                also
                                pay attention to really good writing, the sort of writing you wish you could write.

                        <p>Self-editing is when you improve your own writing by correcting mistakes, revising structure,
                            and
                            honing
                            word choice. Ideally, you’d have a professional editor to handle these areas, but most of us
                            are

                            own! Editing is crucial to the writing process. If you try to make your first draft perfect,
                            keeping
                            track of everything will distract you and some good ideas might fall through the cracks.
                            This
                            harkens
                            back to what sci-fi author C.J. Cherryh once said: <q><em>It is perfectly okay to write
                                    garbage—as

                            an editor. First, we’ll cover a broad checklist of problematic areas to look for when
                            reading
                            your
                            first
                            draft, and then we’ll share some expert tips on self-editing<span class="dots"

                            <h4>Self-editing checklist: What to look for</h4>
                            <p>Once you’re finished with your rough draft, the real self-editing begins. When reading
                                over your
                                work,
                                there’s a lot to keep in mind all at once, so we’ve compiled a useful checklist of areas
                                to look
                                out
                                for. </p>
                            <h5>Spelling and grammar</h5>
                            <p>What’s the difference between editing and proofreading? In a nutshell, proofreading only
                                covers
                                fixing
                                typographical mistakes, whereas editing entails all corrections, including spelling and
                                grammar,
                                but
                                also word choice, clarity, structure, format, tone, and more. Since proofreading is a
                                part of
                                editing,
                                keep an eye out for technical mistakes during this stage.
                                Specifically, watch out for incorrect verb forms and subject-verb agreement, two of the
                                most
                                common
                                writing mistakes. </p>
                            <h5>Clarity</h5>
                            <p>Above all, your writing should be clear. Communication is about getting your message
                                across; it
                                doesn’t
                                matter how poetic your language is if no one knows what you’re talking about. Try to
                                look at
                                your
                                writing from the perspective of the reader, someone who doesn’t know as much about the
                                topic as
                                you
                                do.
                                Would they be able to understand? </p>
                            <h5>Fancy words</h5>
                            <p>Fancy words might discombobulate your reader, but simple words won’t confuse them. Big
                                words can
                                distract
                                your readers, so smart writers save them only for when they’re absolutely necessary. If
                                you can,
                                use
                                a
                                small and simple word that’s easy to understand. In the words of Winston Churchill,
                                winner of
                                the
                                Nobel
                                Prize for Literature, “Short words are best, and old words when short are best of all.”
                            </p>
                            <h5>Sentence structure variety</h5>
                            <p>It’s not just the words themselves that need variety, but also the shape of your
                                sentences. Using
                                the
                                same sentence formats one after another can get daunting for the readers. Vary the
                                length and
                                style
                                of
                                your sentences to keep things interesting.It’s best to maintain the same verb tense
                                throughout
                                your
                                entire piece of writing. But sometimes, especially with nonfiction, writers get so
                                caught up
                                writing
                                that they accidentally switch tenses. Decide which tense to use at the start of
                                self-editing and
                                make
                                sure each active verb follows along. </p>
