                    <p>Reading, writing, speaking, and listening are grounded in the formulation and understanding of
                        written
                        and
                        verbal messages. Without meaning, words and phrases are nothing more than a nonsensical string
                        of sounds
                        or
                        letters. Vocabulary is not an isolated skill; readers, writers, speakers, and listeners marshal
                        what
                        they
                        know about words and phrases to understand and convey coherent messages in what Thorndike termed
                        “a
                        cooperation of many forces” (1917, p. 232). Vocabulary researchers have long advocated for
                        instructional
                        approaches that capitalize on these “many forces,” especially through teaching structural,
                        contextual,
                        and
                        morphemic analysis skills (Baumann, Edwards, & Boland, 2003; Brusnighan & Folk, 2012), using
                        oral
                        language
                        channels (Beck & McKeown, 2007), leveraging texts to facilitate discussion and interaction
                        (Lennox,
                        2013),
                        and teaching for word appreciation and word consciousness (Graves & Watts-Taffe, 2008)<span

                        <p>The demand on vocabulary knowledge intensifies throughout the elementary and middle school
                            years,
                            especially
                            in regard to print. Nagy and Anderson (1984) estimated that students entering ninth grade
                            needed to know
                            and
                            understand 88,500 word families, stating that “even the most ruthlessly systematic direct
                            vocabulary
                            instruction could neither account for a significant proportion of all the words children
                            actually learn,
                            nor
                            cover more than a modest proportion of the words they will encounter in school reading
                            materials” (p.
                            304).
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet in too many cases, vocabulary instruction is isolated from other aspects of the
                            instructional day,
                            particularly in content area learning. It is far too common to assign students a list of
                            words (usually
                            technical terms) that will be used in a social studies or science unit and then ask them to
                            look up
                            words
                            and write definitions so that they can then compose solitary sentences. This limited
                            exposure to words
                            and
                            phrases in decontextualized situations has not proven to be effective, nor is it of a
                            sufficient
                            intensity.
                            In an observational study of Canadian upper elementary classrooms, Scott, Jamieson-Noel, and
                            Asselin
                            (2003)
                            found that 39% of vocabulary instructional time was dedicated to definitions, mostly through
                            dictionary
                            and
                            worksheet use. Vocabulary instruction in elementary content area classes was even more
                            limited. The same
                            researchers found that an average of only 1.4% of social studies, mathematics, science, and
                            arts
                            instructional time was devoted to vocabulary development. Whether your goal is to meet the
                            demands of
                            the
                            Common Core State Standards, or for locations not impacted directly by these standards but
                            where
                            vocabulary
                            is a significant concern, we recommend that teachers attend to four significant components
                            of word
                            learning:
                            wide reading, selecting words to teach, modeling word solving, and providing students
                            opportunities
                            through
                            collaborative conversations to actually use their growing vocabularies</p>

                <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
                <img src="media/vocabulary-2.jpeg" alt="image of vocabulary" class="imageArticle-img">
                <div class="imageArticle-article">
                    <p>Vocabulary refers to the words we must understand to communicate effectively. Educators often
                        consider
                        four types of vocabulary: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.</p>

                    <p>Listening vocabulary refers to the words we need to know to understand what we hear. Speaking
                        vocabulary
                        consists of the words we use when we speak. Reading vocabulary refers to the words we need to
                        know
                        to
                        understand what we read. Writing vocabulary consists of the words we use in writing.</p>

                    <p>Vocabulary plays an important part in learning to read. Beginning readers must use the words they
                        hear
                        orally to make sense of the words they see in print. Kids who hear more words spoken at home
                        learn
                        more
                        words and enter school with better vocabularies. This larger vocabulary pays off exponentially
                        as a
                        child progresses through school<span class="dots" id="dots-2">...</span></p>

                    <!-- the content below will show up when the "Read more" button is clicked and 
                         it will be hidden when the "Read less" button is clicked-->
                    <div class="more-content" id="more-content-2">
                        <p>Consider, for example, what happens when a beginning reader comes to the word <i>dig</i> in a
                            book.
                            As
                            she begins to figure out the sounds represented by the letters d, i, g, the reader
                            recognizes that
                            the
                            sounds make up a very familiar word that she has heard and said many times. It is harder for
                            a
                            beginning
                            reader to figure out words that are not already part of their speaking (oral) vocabulary.
                        </p>

                        <p>Vocabulary is key to reading comprehension. Readers cannot understand what they are reading
                            without
                            knowing what most of the words mean. As children learn to read more advanced texts, they
                            must learn
                            the
                            meaning of new words that are not part of their oral vocabulary.</p>

                        <p>The scientific research on vocabulary instruction reveals that most vocabulary is learned
                            indirectly
                            and
                            that some vocabulary must be taught directly. Thus, research supports using a combination of
                            both
                            indirect and direct approaches.</p>

                        <h4>Indirect vocabulary learning</h4>

                        <p>Children learn the meanings of most words indirectly, through everyday experiences with oral
                            and
                            written
                            language. Children learn word meanings indirectly in three ways:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>They engage daily in oral language</li>
                            <li>They listen to adults read to them</li>
                            <li>They read extensively on their own</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Direct vocabulary learning</h4>

                        <p>Although a great deal of vocabulary is learned indirectly, some vocabulary should be taught
                            directly.
                        </p>

                        <p>Direct instruction helps students learn difficult words, such as words that represent complex
                            concepts
                            that are not part of the students' everyday experiences. Direct instruction of vocabulary
                            relevant
                            to a
                            given text leads to better reading comprehension.</p>

                        <p>Direct instruction includes:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Providing students with instruction in specific words that are important to students’
                                content
                                learning or understanding of a particular text</li>
                            <li>Teaching students more general word-learning strategies that they can apply to a variety
                                of
                                words,
                                such as analyzing parts of words (e.g., root words)</li>

                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Learning vocabulary is a very important part of learning a language. The more words you know, the
                        more
                        you will be able to understand what you hear and read; and the better you will be able to say
                        what
                        you
                        want to when speaking or writing.</p>
                    <h4>Which words to learn</h4>
                    <p>Every day you hear or read many new English words. You also find them in your dictionary when you
                        are
                        translating from your own language. You can’t possibly learn all these new words, so your first
                        problem
                        is to decide which ones to concentrate on. Here are some suggestions:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>learn the words that are important to the subjects you are studying</li>
                        <li>learn the words that you read or hear again and again</li>
                        <li>learn the words that you know you will often want to use yourself</li>
                        <li>do not learn words that are rare or not useful (your teacher can help you with this)<span
                                class="dots" id="dots-3">...</span></li>
                    </ul>

                        <h4>How to learn words</h4>
                        <p>Once you have chosen which words to learn, you next have to decide how you are going to learn
                            them.
                            Here
                            are a few ideas:</p>
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>write the words in a notebook (with their translations or definitions)</li>
                            <li>write the words and definitions on small cards </li>
                            <li>say the words many times (if you have an electronic dictionary you can hear how the word
                                is pronounced)</li>
                            <li>put the words into different groups (you could use a graphic organiser)</li>
                            <li>write them in a file for use with a computer program</li>
                            <li>make associations (in pictures or with other words)</li>
                            <li>ask someone to test you</li>
                            <li>use the words in your own speaking or writing</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Some students put a tick or cross in their dictionary next to every word they look up. The
                            next time
                            they
                            turn to a page with a marked word, they quickly check to see if they remember the meaning of
                            that
                            word.
                        </p>
                        <p>In all of the above ways, you are doing something with the words. It’s usually not enough to
                            just
                            read
                            through a list of words with their definitions or translations and try to remember them.
                            <span id="margText">Most students find that they memorise words better if they do something
                                with them.
                                Even better is to try and learn the word in a typical combination with other
                                words.</span>
                            Learning
                            that <strong>to apologize</strong> means <em>to say sorry</em> is a good start, but it's
                            much better
                            to
                            learn a whole expression containing the word, e.g. <em>He apologized for being late</em>.
                            Not only
                            is
                            this often easier to remember, but you are also learning some very important information on
                            how the
                            word
                            is used.

                        <h3 id="test">Learning for vocabulary tests</h3>

                        <p>
                            The previous section on this page gives general advice on how to learn the words that you
                            have
                            chosen as
                            important for you. Often, however, you will be given a set of words by your teacher and told
                            to
                            learn
                            them for a vocabulary test. In this case you need to be sure exactly how you will be tested,
                            because
                            this will influence how you learn the words. There are several ways that the teacher might
                            test your
                            vocabulary learning, but the ways are broadly divided into two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You will be given the word and have to:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>write a definition</li>
                                    <li>use it in an example sentence</li>
                                    <li>translate it into your language</li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>You will be given:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>a definition</li>
                                    <li>a gapped example sentence</li>
                                    <li>the translation in your language</li>

                                </ul>
                                and you have to write the English word.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            If you do a vocabulary test from the second group above, then in most cases you will need to
                            learn
                            the
                            exact spelling of the word and will lose marks if you misspell it. As with all tests, be
                            sure to ask
                            the
                            teacher exactly how you will be tested and exactly how you will be graded. You will then
                            avoid
                            wasting
                            time studying something that you will be not be tested on.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning vocabulary by reading</h4>
                        <p>The way you learned very many of the words in your own language was by meeting them in the
                            books and
                            magazines you read. The context of a new word in a sentence or story was often enough for
                            you to
                            guess
                            the meaning. Meeting the word again and again in your reading helped you learn it for use in
                            your
                            own
                            speaking and writing. Doing lots of extra reading for pleasure - both fiction and
                            non-fiction - is
                            an
                            excellent way to learn new English words, too. But choose books that you find quite easy to
                            read.
                            Difficult stories or texts that you struggle to understand will not help you to develop your
                            vocabulary
                            the natural way. But remember: to learn new words from reading you have to read <strong>A
                                LOT</strong>!
                        </p>

                        <h4>More information about learning words</h4>
                        <p>The vocabulary you know can be divided into two groups - passive vocabulary and active
                            vocabulary.
                            Passive vocabulary contains all the words that you understand when you read or listen, but
                            which you
                            do
                            not use (or cannot remember) in your own writing and speaking.
                            Active vocabulary is all the words you understand, plus all the words that you can use
                            yourself.
                            Your
                            active vocabulary, in English and your own language, is probably much smaller than your
                            passive
                            vocabulary.</p>
                        <p>The more you work on learning a word, as suggested above, the more likely it is that it will
                            become
                            part
                            of your active vocabulary.</p>
                        <h4>Things to know about the words you learn</h4>
                        <p>Usually the first things you learn about a new English word are what it means and its
                            translation in
                            your
                            own language. But there are other things you need to find out before you can say that you
                            know a
                            word
                            like a native speaker does. For example, you have to learn:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>how it is spelled</li>
                            <li>how it is pronounced</li>
                            <li>how it is inflected (i.e. how it changes if it is a verb, noun or adjective)</li>
                            <li>other grammar information about it</li>
                            <li>how it collocates (i.e. what other words are often used with it)</li>
                            <li>if it has a particular style or register</li>
                            <li>the context in which it is most likely to be used Types of Vocabulary</li>
                        </ul>
