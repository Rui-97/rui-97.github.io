        <h1>My English Club Website Report</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In this introductory section, I will talk about the purpose of my website and the type of structure I have
                chosen to implement on the site. First of all, I will introduce what is the site about and what is the
                purpose of the site. This is a newsletter website for My English Club. The purpose of the site is to display
                high-quality articles about how to improve English from different aspects. Members from My English Club can
                visit the website and read articles that can help them improve their English in an appropriate and effective
                way. In addition to displaying articles, some good resources for English learning such as videos, learning
                websites and books are also provided on the website. Moreover, visitors can subscribe to My English Club
                newsletter through the website by submitting a form. Next, I will talk about the structure of my website. I
                used a hierarchical structure for my website. The website starts a broad set of information (parent pages)
                that filters down into more detailed information (child pages). Four different aspects of English learning
                are displayed on the home page and from the home page, visitors can choose the part they are interested in
                for more detailed information.

            <h2>Inspiration </h2>
            <p>
                In this section, I will talk about 3 things that have inspired me when creating the website. The first one I
                would like to talk about is the English club I took last year. The organizers of the English club used to
                share articles about English learning to help members improve English more effectively. However, the way
                they shared the article is not quite effective. They usually printed the articles out and gave out the
                articles to members in the monthly gathering. So, in the design stage of my website, I decided to create a
                newsletter website for an English club where members can read articles at any time and anywhere, and the
                organizers of the club can update the articles frequently and easily. The second thing that inspired me is
                the <a href="https://www.englishclub.com/learn-english.htm">EnglishClub website</a>. This website gave me
                some basic idea
                about the structure of my website and how to categorize the content. The last thing that inspired me is
                newspapers. Since newspapers always contain a sidebar for some subsidiary content, it inspires me to have
                sidebars on my site for some less important content.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, I will discuss 2 ways that I used to make my website accessible to those with different
                abilities and needs. First, my website is responsive, which enables visitors to browse the website using
                different devices. The responsive website allows the website content to be displayed in appropriate layouts
                and to meet the needs of browsing my website with different screen-size devices. Second, my website is
                accessible to those with slight visual impairment, they can listen to the audio in the videos on my website.
            </p>

            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, I will discuss 3 ways in which I considered the usability of my website. The first part is
                adding “read more” and “read less” buttons to make the website more concise for visitors. Since the main
                purpose of my website is to display articles, most pages of my website contain a large number of paragraphs.
                A large number of words displayed on a page may make the visitor feel overwhelmed at first sight and lose
                interest in continuing to browse. Adding “read more” and “read less” buttons allows visitors to control the
                reading load on this page. Visitors can explore the rest of an article by clicking the read more button and
                hide the content when they finish reading. The second thing that makes my website more usable is the “go to
                top” button. After finding browning one page, the “go to top” button allows visitors to easily jump back to
                the top of the page where the navigation bar is located and to continue to visit other pages of my website.
                The last part that makes my website more usable is the submission form. In order to submit the form,
                visitors must fill out the form in the correct format. When the form is submitted successfully, an alter box
                will pop up and confirm the submission. This can make sure all the data sent to the server is valid.

            <h2>Learning</h2><a href=""></a>
            <p>
                In this section, I will talk about 3 things I have learned when creating my website. The first thing I have
                learned is how to use Bootstrap. I learned it by visiting the <a
                    href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> website
                and browsing the documents and examples provided on the website. I have used Bootstrap to style the form and
                some of the buttons on my website, which makes styling website more efficient. Additionally, I have also
                learned how to insert icons by using Font Awesome. By including the correct HTML tags and class names, the
                icons can be presented on my website. I learned how to use it by watching tutorial videos on YouTube and
                visiting <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> website. Moreover, I also learned how to better
                utilize<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 schools</a> as a reference or learning resource to help me
                complete my site. There
                are lots of useful resources on W3 schools website. Checking the website frequently and searching HTML, CSS,
                or Javascript can be helpful.

            <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, I will talk about the aspect of my work that I think is particularly successful and why. I
                think the layout of my website is particularly successful because it is concise and easy to follow. The
                content of my website consists of two parts the main content and sidebar. The main content section includes
                all the articles related to the specific topic and the sidebar is where all the learning resources such as
                videos, learning websites, and recommended books are placed in. This kind of layout is straightforward and
                easy to follow. Visitors can easily focus on the main content section and move to the sidebar for extra
                resources and information.
            </p>
        </section>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, I will talk about the aspect that could be improved. I think I could make my website more
                dynamic. Although the essential function like read more buttons has already on my website, more functions
                can make my website more dynamic. Changing site font-size function where visitors can change font-size by
                clicking different sizes of As can be included in the website.
